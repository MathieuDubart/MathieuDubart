# Hey, I'm Mathieu 👋
→ I'm an iOS & Fullstack Developer, Product Oriented Engineer, trained with GOBELINS standards. I enjoy building projects with Swift and SwiftUI to experiment in a fun way. I'm aiming to build helpful apps designed to help people with their struggles or in their everyday life.

→ I am convinced that development is an excellent way to help others and make the world a little better in our own way and on our own scale, and I would like to commit myself to it as much as possible.
