# Hey, I'm Mathieu 👋
I'm a Fullstack Developer/Project Manager at [MyRole](https://myrole.fr/) and a last year master's degree student at [GOBELINS](https://www.gobelins.fr/ecole).
Also, I enjoy building projects with Swift and SwiftUI alongside my work-study program and school projects, to experiment in a fun way.
I'm aiming to build helpful apps designed to help people with their struggles or in their everyday life.

Currently looking for an iOS development opportunity.
