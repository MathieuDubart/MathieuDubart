# Hey, I'm Mathieu 👋
→ I'm a Fullstack Developer/Project Manager at [MyRole](https://myrole.fr/) and a last year master's degree student at [GOBELINS](https://www.gobelins.fr/ecole).
Also, I enjoy building projects with Swift and SwiftUI alongside my work-study program and school projects, to experiment in a fun way.
I'm aiming to build helpful apps designed to help people with their struggles or in their everyday life.

→ I am convinced that development is an excellent way to help others and make the world a little better in our own way and on our own scale, and I would like to commit myself to it as much as possible.

→ Currently looking for an iOS development opportunity.
